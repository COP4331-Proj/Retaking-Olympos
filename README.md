# Retaking Olympos

## Project Vision

For all video game enthusiasts who wish for a painstaking gladiatorial combat and management game with a mythologically accurate story—with only a few artistic liberties taken—Retaking Olympos is the game for them. This game leads the player along a double-sided story of a demigod turned slave who must earn his freedom, into a man with a mission to raise a small band of elite gladiators to retake his holy home. Unlike other combat games Retaking Olympus has customizable characters with choices of weapon style, skills, and even a management aspect of gathering and training your chosen few gladiators. Our product offers the player a unique and interesting story as they attempt to conquer the heavens themselves.
